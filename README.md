## What I have learned

- The use of ReactJs per se, how the component's architecture and hierarchie can be build and how to optimize rendering.
- I've used redux for intercomponent communication and async actions.
- The use of High Order Components for error wrapping and auxiliary component.
- The use of Axios for HTTP requests.
- Firebase for data storage and user authentification.
- React Hooks to use state management and other class based component features in the function based components.
- Unit testing with Enzyme and Jest.
